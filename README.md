# CDC-Diabetes-Health-Indicators-UCI-Machine-Learning
This lab applies nonlinear models (RBF, Perceptron, MLP) to the CDC Diabetes dataset. After preprocessing and splitting the data, models are trained, tuned, and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, then compared with linear results.
